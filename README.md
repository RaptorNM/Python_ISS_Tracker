# Python_ISS_Tracker
A simple ISS tracker and distance calculator written in python

The first upload is only a simple version of the program, it will run once, upon execution and give the distance in Km as well as the approximate location of the user and the exact location of the ISS using http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json. The user location is obtained via ipinfo, which will only give the location your IP gives, that is the general location. 

This is a simple project, but I aim to add a GUI at least. Maybe also a moving map, the ability to use precise GPS location of the user.
